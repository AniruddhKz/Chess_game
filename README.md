Chess Game Project - 
This is a simple text-based chess game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to play a game of chess on the command line interface.

Features - 
Basic chess game functionality including moving pieces, capturing opponent pieces, and basic check validation.
Text-based interface for displaying the chess board and prompting players for moves.
Simple move validation to ensure that players make legal moves according to the rules of chess.

How to Play - 
Each player takes turns entering their moves in the format "startSquare-endSquare" (e.g., "e2-e4").
The game will display the updated board after each move and prompt the next player for their move.
Players continue taking turns until one player wins the game or the game ends in a draw.
